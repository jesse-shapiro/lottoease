# LottoEase

LottoEase is designed to help you quickly and seamlessly enter Broadway lotteries. 

In order to enter a Broadway lottery, you usually need to input the same information over and over again for each show: 
- First name
- Last name
- Email
- Birthday 
- Zip code
- etc... the list goes on and on!

Here's where LottoEase comes into play - with some quick initial setup, you will be able to enter all the Broadway lotteries with the click of a button!
